# restaurant-page

A simple home page for an imaginary restaurant with multiple tabs to navigate through.

### Dev Notes:
This project is meant to hone and demonstrate skills in using webpack to manage a project with many assets, pages, etc.
To that end, we won't focus on beauty or responsiveness. Instead we seek to develop a deep understanding of the webpack 
workflow we might encounter in industry.
